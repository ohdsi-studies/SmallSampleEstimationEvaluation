\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type \code{ConnectionDetails} created using the
function \code{createConnectionDetails} in the
\code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has write
privileges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{A database schema containing health care data in the OMOP Commond
Data Model. Note that for SQL Server, botth the database and schema
should be specified, e.g. 'cdm_schema.dbo'.}

\item{exposureDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema where the exposure cohorts will be 
created. Only needed if \code{referenceSet = 'ohdsiDevelopment'}. Note
that for SQL Server, both the database and schema should be specified, 
e.g. 'cdm_schema.dbo'.}

\item{exposureTable}{The name of the table that will be created to store the exposure 
cohorts. Only needed if \code{referenceSet = 'ohdsiDevelopment'}.}

\item{outcomeDatabaseSchema}{The database schema where the target outcome table is located. Note
that for SQL Server, both the database and schema should be
specified, e.g. 'cdm_schema.dbo'}

\item{outcomeTable}{The name of the table where the outcomes will be stored.}

\item{nestingDatabaseSchema}{(For the OHDSI Methods Benchmark and OHDSI Development Set only) The
database schema where the nesting outcome table is located. Note that 
for SQL Server, both the database and schema should be specified, e.g.
 'cdm_schema.dbo'.}

\item{nestingTable}{(For the OHDSI Methods Benchmark and OHDSI Development Set only) The 
name of the table where the nesting cohorts will be stored.}

\item{referenceSet}{The name of the reference set for which outcomes need to be created.
Currently supported are "ohdsiMethodsBenchmark", and "ohdsiDevelopment".}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of local folder to place intermediary results; make sure to use
forward slashes (/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since
this greatly impacts performance.}

\description{
Create cohorts used for the evaluation.
}
\details{
This function will create the outcomes of interest and nesting cohorts referenced in the various
reference sets. The outcomes of interest are derives using information like diagnoses, procedures,
and drug prescriptions. The outcomes are stored in a table on the database server.

For the 'ohdsiMethodsBenchmark' reference set, the exposures are taken from the drug_era table, and
are therefore not generated as separate cohorts, and an exposure cohort table therefore needn't be supplied. 
For the 'ohdsiDevelopment' reference set, exposure cohorts will be generated.
